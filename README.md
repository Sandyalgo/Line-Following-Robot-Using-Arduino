What is Arduino UNO?

    Before diving deep into the discussion let us first have understanding about what the Arduino is?
    The Arduino is the open source microcontroller development board based on the ATMEGA328P microcontroller IC designed to provide the simple and cheap platform to the hobbyists and students for designing their digital and embedded systems projects.
    The ATMEGA328P microcontroller IC is the heart of the Arduino microcontroller development that is the board is designed around the ATMEGA328P microcontroller IC.
    The Arduino UNO microcontroller development looks like the one in the above image
